HOW TO DETECT CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)? 
Early CKD often has no sign or symptoms. A person can lose up to 90% of their kidney function before experiencing any signs 
But it can be detected by simple tests: a urine test to check if there is any protein in your urine, or a blood test to measure the level of creatinine in your blood.

Signs of advancing CKD include:
	-swollen ankles
	-fatigue
	-difficulty concentrating
	-decreased appetite
	-foamy urine 

Can Chronic Kidney Disease affect my health in other ways? 
People with chronic kidney disease can develop:
	-High blood pressure
	-Heart attack and stroke
	-Anemia (low number of red blood cells)
	-Bone disease

Controlling blood pressure is very important.
	-The goal is to keep your blood pressure below 140/80 (usually stated as “140 over 80”).
	-Many people need to take several medicines to get to this blood pressure goal. 
	-If you have side effects or want to stop the medicines for any reason, be sure to discuss this with your doctor first.
	-Medicine is just one step to lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol. 
	-You should also: Get regular exercise. Talk with your doctor about what is best for you.

TAKE ACTION!
Early detection of kidney disease can help to prevent the progression of the disease. This means you are less likely to experience kidney failure and need dialysis or a kidney
transplant to keep you alive.

If you have risk factors for kidney disease, it is important that you have a regular Kidney Health Check with your General Physician or health service. 

A Kidney Health Check doesn’t take long and can be done by your General Physician. It involves simple blood and urine tests together with a blood pressure check.
