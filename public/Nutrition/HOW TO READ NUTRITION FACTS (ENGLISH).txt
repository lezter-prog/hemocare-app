how to read nutrition facts

What does a Nutrition Facts label do?
A Nutrition Facts label lists the nutritional content, the serving size, and the calories for a recommended serving of a food product. This helps consumers make the best decision on how much to eat, maybe when they want to eat this food, or how they can better balance their food choices throughout the day. In addition to the Nutrition Facts label, there is also an ingredients label. This lists all ingredients in the food product from the largest amount at the beginning to the smallest amounts of ingredients at the end. This is where consumers can find information about what is in their food, such as allergies or if a product is a whole grain item.
