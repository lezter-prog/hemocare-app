8 Golden rules

LEARN TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR KIDNEYS EVERYDAY BY FOLLOWING THESE 8 RULES

Keep fit, be active
Regular physical activity helps maintain overall health, including kidney function, by improving circulation and reducing the risk of obesity and related conditions.

Eat a healthy diet
A balanced diet low in processed foods and high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins supports kidney health by providing essential nutrients and minimizing the risk of conditions like diabetes and hypertension.

Check and control your blood sugar
Consistently high blood sugar levels can damage the kidneys over time, so monitoring and managing blood sugar levels are crucial for kidney health, especially for individuals with diabetes.

Check and control your blood pressure
High blood pressure can strain the kidneys and lead to kidney disease, so it's essential to monitor blood pressure regularly and take steps to keep it within a healthy range.

Take appropriate fluid intake
Staying hydrated is important for kidney function, but excessive fluid intake can strain the kidneys, so it's important to strike a balance and drink fluids in moderation.

Don’t smoke
Smoking damages blood vessels and can worsen kidney function, so quitting smoking or avoiding tobacco products altogether is essential for kidney health.

Don’t take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory/pain-killer pills regularly
Overuse of certain pain medications, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can harm the kidneys, so it's important to use these medications sparingly and under medical guidance.

Get your kidney function checked if you have any ‘high risk’ factors such as diabetes, hypertension, or obesity
Regular check-ups and screenings are crucial for early detection and management of kidney disease, especially for individuals with risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, or obesity.
